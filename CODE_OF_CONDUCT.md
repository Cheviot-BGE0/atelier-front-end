## Roles and Responsibilities 
Roles are guidelines; we will be adaptable and flexible throughout our production process and reassess responsibilities as need be. 
### Team Member Responsibilities
- Don't do any work that isn't ticketed. Capture everything that you're doing, all your work, in the form of a Trello ticket.
- Make sure to listen to feedback that is given to you, and to give feedback on others' code.
- Remove all comments and console logs before submitting a pull request; ship hygienic code.
- Make sure to ship unit tests along with your code.
- Commit to diagramming and taking engineering notes that document any troubles we ran into or creative solutions we found. Share individual documentation with the documentation manager. 
- Attend all sprint meetings and stand-up meetings unless in case of emergencies.

### Workflow Manager
- Managing git workflow: pull requests, git commits, pushing.
- Handle merge conflicts, etc.
- Ensure feedback is given to each pull request before merging.
### Goal Tracker
- Determining what work needs to be done by what time.
- Managing Trello tickets.
- In decisions that are split, the Goal Tracker ultimately chooses which direction to move forward in.
### Documentation Manager
- Responsible for organizing project information into one comprehensive document.
- Authoring/organizing READMEs.
- Take notes during stand-up and other meetings.
### Lead Investigator
- Compiling a list of possible solutions for any given problem.
- Contrasting pros and cons between options and sharing them with the team.
- Making sure the Goal Tracker can always make as informed a decision as possible.

## Communication 
### Slack
- For day-to-day communication and messages.
- Hub for links, documents, spreadsheets.
### Zoom
- Sprint planning meetings every two days. 
- Daily standup meetings.
### Trello
- Task communication.
### Github
- Code reviews - comments on each pull request.


## Conflicts and Decision Making
In any conflict, Granite Devs will try to reach an agreement democratically at each step, remembering to operate with solid communication and empathy.

In split decisions, the Goal Tracker will hear all sides and ultimately choose which direction to move forward. 

In the event that there is a conflict outside the scope of the goal trackerâ€™s concerns, we will call for a vote. In the event of a split decision, we will allow a tiebreaker in an alternating sequence. 

## Accountability
Deadlines and tickets will be the primary metric to which we will hold ourselves and each other accountable. In the event that any of us are having difficulty meeting deadlines or closing tickets solo, it is our responsibility to communicate that to the team and ask for help. 

## Team Culture & DEI
Our Granite Dev mantra: Listen first to empathize and understand, only then to respond. 

The best way to foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusivity is by ensuring that we all agree to be vulnerable: to be as transparent as possible with how we feel about our work, where we are at, and how we can be helped, and to humbly accept that help instead of getting defensive.

We will include our ideals of DEI in the products we build. We will strive to make our tech accessible for _all_ people. 

We also need to remember: edge cases are people. **Take no one for granite!**

## Team Support & Respect
We will support each other with check-ins during stand-up, fostering open communications, sharing resources or workflows, and overall moral support as we all have one common goal.
